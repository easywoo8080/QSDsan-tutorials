Tutorials
=========

To help you familiarize with ``QSDsan``, we include two types of tutorials - topical tutorials that cover on one or multiple classes of ``QSDsan``, or design tutorials that show you how to translate a practical design problem into coding in QSDsan. Follow them to get started!

All tutorials are written using Jupyter Notebook, you can run your own Jupyter environment, or you can visit `this page <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/QSD-Group/QSDsan/main?filepath=%2Fdocs%2Fsource%2Ftutorials>`_ to run the Jupyter environment in your browser.

For each of these tutorials and examples, we are also recording videos where one of the QSD group members will go through the material step-by-step. We are gradually releasing these videos on our `YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8fyVeo9xf10KeuZ_4vC_GA>`_ so subscribe to receive updates!
